4. Run: npm run dev

2. Run: npm run dev
3. Go to http://localhost:3002
4. Click "Register" and create doctor account

STEP 3: Seed Dummy Data
------------------------
DOUBLE-CLICK THIS FILE: seed-data.bat

This will create:
- 5 realistic patients in your database
- 4 consultations with doctors
- All patients assigned to your ASHA worker

STEP 4: Refresh and See Data
-----------------------------
1. Go back to http://localhost:3001 (ASHA app)
2. Refresh the page (F5)
3. You should now see:
   - 5 patients in stats
   - "Follow-up with Geeta Sharma" task (clickable!)
   - Click tasks to mark them as done
   - Go to "My Patients" to see all 5 patients

4. For Doctor (http://localhost:3002):
   - You'll see 4 patients in queue
   - Each shows the ASHA worker who referred them

FEATURES YOU CAN USE:
---------------------
✓ Click any stat card to navigate
✓ Click "Follow-up with Geeta Sharma" task
✓ Mark tasks as done/undone
✓ Click "Send to Doctor" on pending patients
✓ See real patient data (no fake 156 numbers!)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
- If you see 0 patients: You forgot to run seed-data.bat
- If seed fails: Make sure you created ASHA worker account first
- If tasks don't work: Clear browser cache and refresh
